## How Nexla Works
---
1. **Data Ingestion**: Nexla begins by ingesting data from a variety of sources, including databases, APIs, and data lakes. This is facilitated through its pre-built connectors, which allow for seamless integration without the need for custom coding.

2. **Data Transformation**: Once the data is ingested, Nexla's platform automatically detects and maps data schemas, reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy. Users can perform data transformations using a no-code/low-code interface, ensuring that data is in the desired format for analysis or further processing.

3. **Data Validation and Quality Checks**: Nexla applies automated data quality checks throughout the integration process, ensuring data accuracy and completeness. Anomaly detection features identify unusual patterns, allowing users to address potential data quality issues promptly.

4. **Data Flow Creation**: Users can create bi-directional data flows that move data from one point to multiple destinations. This is done through a user-friendly interface that allows for the configuration of data sources, transformations, and destinations in just a few steps.

5. **Data Monitoring and Error Management**: Nexla provides comprehensive monitoring and error management capabilities. Users receive notifications and alerts about data flow execution, and any detected errors are quarantined for debugging or reprocessing, ensuring resilient data pipelines.

6. **Nexsets and Data Products**: Nexla organizes data into Nexsets, which are logical entities that provide a consistent interface for data regardless of its schema or format. This makes data easily shareable and ready to use, facilitating faster transformation and integration.

7. **Data Delivery**: Finally, the transformed and validated data is delivered to the desired destination, which can include databases, data warehouses, or external partners. Nexla's platform supports real-time data processing and streaming, ensuring that data is always up-to-date and accessible.
